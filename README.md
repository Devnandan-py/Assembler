# Assembler
An assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that 
the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations.
Our aim was to convert the Hack Assembly code to binary code.

The assignment compraised of 5 questions.

1. Write a program to read assembly program (.asm file) and print the same program to a new
   file by ignoring white space (_no_whitespace.asm).
2. Write a program to read the above generated _no_whitespace.asm file and identify the label
   symbols and variables. Write those label symbols and variables to another file(symbolsandvariables.asm).
3. Write a program to construct a Symbol table for the given .asm file and print it to another file
   (symboltable.asm).
4. Write a program to convert a standalone A instruction into binary (generate .hack output file).
5. Write a program to convert a standalone C instruction into binary (generate .hack output file)

All the questions were completed on 19/1/2023
The Project was done along with Viserion-7
